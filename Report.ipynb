    "The film industry is interestingly where art and commerce intersect. Our interaction with film and the industry has been in the context of a consumer. Being able to understand what drives audiences to theaters will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of film through a different perspective. As an industry with so much culture and history, we hope to explore the story of cinema. \n",

    "**Why was this dataset created?**  \n",
    "This dataset was created by GroupLens, a research lab at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The group is made up of students and faculty in the university's Department of Computer Science and Engineering. GroupLens studies social computing by building systems and analyzing their use by people. One of these systems is MovieLens, a website with thousands of registered that helps people find movies to watch. The platform is used to help researchers study content recommendation, user interface design, and other areas of interest. In creating the website, GroupLens compiled movie rating datasets that we use for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**  \n",
    "The dataset was created by the research lab GroupLens. Its creation was likely funded by this research lab, in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**  \n",
    "The dataset relies solely on APIs from TMDB and GroupLens, which means the quality and completeness of the data depend on how these sources collect and maintain their records. If certain movies are less documented or if there are inconsistencies in data entry, this could result in missing or incomplete metadata. Movie ratings are inherently subjective and can vary significantly based on individual viewer preferences, cultural context, and personal experiences. This subjectivity introduces variability that may not accurately reflect the overall quality or success of a film. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**  \n",
    "The raw source data was taken from 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset is an ensemble of data collected from TMDB and GroupLens. The Movie Details, Credits and Keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. The Movie Links and Ratings have been obtained from the Official GroupLens website. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. The data has been processed for these specific data points: cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts, and vote averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**  \n",
    "The individual who created the dataset posted it for public use on Kaggle. There is a CC0: Public Domain license which means this dataset has been dedicated to the public domain because the creator has waived all of their rights to the work worldwide under copyright law. They hope that the dataset can help predict movie revenue/success based on certain metrics. \n",

    "The dataset that we use will inherently have bias because movie reviews are user-generated and are subjective. Highly-rated movies may attract more votes, while lesser-known films may receive fewer ratings which can skew the average rating of a movie. There could also be temporal bias, where older movies may have fewer ratings or skewed perceptions compared to newer films that have more exposure. Genre classifications can be subjective, leading to inconsistencies in how movies are categorized. Ratings can differ significantly by region or demographic, which is not captured in the dataset. Movie review systems like IMDb are constantly updated, which can lead to versioning issues if datasets are not synchronized properly. Especially because the data contains movies released prior to or on July 2017, this does not account for the most recent movies released."
